## UHLC
The UHLC project was completed for the Westminster College Web Apps course. My group (three delevopers and two designers) were tasked with creating a new website for the Utah Health Literacy Coalition. We decided to create a Wordpress site to allow UHLC to continue making content changes if they choose to. On this project I worked primarily on developing the frontend UI to match the designers vision. However, I did extensive work with the database integration as well.

## Spelic
The Spelic project was completed for the Westminster College Software Engineering class. For this class we got put into groups of four developers and were tasked with creating an application of our choice that can serve as a platform to help young children learn Math or English. Our group choose to create a spelling game, modeled after the classic asteroids game. The project was completed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The web app was hosted on Firebase Hosting using Firebase Function and Firebase Realtime Database for the backend.
