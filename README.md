## UHLC
The UHLC project was completed for the Westminster College Web Apps course. My group (three delevopers and two designers) were tasked with creating a new website for the Utah Health Literacy Coalition. We decided to create a Wordpress site to allow UHLC to continue making content changes if they choose to. On this project I worked primarily on developing the frontend UI to match the designers vision. However, I did extensive work with the database integration as well.
